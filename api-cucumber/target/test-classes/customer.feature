  Scenario Outline: Boarding new customer
    Given I have the data to create customer with "<firstName>", "<lastName>", "<phone>", "<address1>", "<address2>"
#    And I use customer header
#    When I create post request to create customer
#    Then I get status code 201 from database
#    And response body should contain
#      | firstName |
#      | lastName  |
#      | phone     |
#      | addresses |
#      | id        |
